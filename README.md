##v1.0 Delivery.
**_Completed all basic features_**
- [x] Record a square video with built-in camera.
- [x] Limit recording to 30s or less.
- [x] Save recorded video to device. (mp4)
- [x] Plays back a preview when finished recording.
    
###Extras:
    1) Added a recorded video gallery as a placeholder.
        Please note: This gallery is for placement only, and is intended only to provide look-and-feel.
    2) Added a visual representation of the 30 second timer to the video preview texture.
    3) Added logic to lock orientation while recording.
    
    I was aiming to deliver a few other items, but ran out of time :
        a) Obtain video still shots (thumbnail) of each recorded video
        b) Populate video gallery with these thumbnails
        c) Use the thumbnails as buttons to launch recorded videos
       
###Additional Notes: 
```
    -No consideration was given to maintaining aspect ratio of the videos.
    -Videos are saved to local storage in MP4 format.
    -The default camera (generally located on back of device, not front) was used for this demo in case 
    there are test devices without bi-directional cameras.

    -Application was tested on:
    ● HTC One A9 phone device running Android 6.0.1 (Marshmallow)
    ● Tagital T10Plus Tablet (7") running Android 5.1.1 (Lollipop)
```
